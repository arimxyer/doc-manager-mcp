## Next Steps [IF PRE-SPEC]

1. Complete this requirements document
2. Run `/speckit.specify` to create formal spec
3. Run `/speckit.clarify` if needed
4. Run `/speckit.plan` for implementation strategy
5. Run `/speckit.tasks` to break into actionable tasks
6. Implement systematically with testing

## NEXT STEPS [IF POST-SPEC]

1. Complete this requirements document with all identified improvements
2. Analyze and assess the improvements:
   - Categorize by impact (high/medium/low)
   - Categorize by effort (small/medium/large)
   - Identify any breaking changes or risks
3. Put forth up to 3 different action plans with your recommendation:
   - **Option A:** Implement all improvements immediately
   - **Option B:** Prioritize high-impact, low-effort improvements first
   - **Option C:** Bundle improvements into a follow-up spec
   - [Your recommendation with rationale]
4. Based on chosen action plan:
   - **If implementing directly:** Create task list and proceed systematically
   - **If creating follow-up spec:** Run `/speckit.specify` with this document as input
   - **If deferring:** Archive this document for future reference
5. Implement chosen improvements with testing
6. Verify no regressions in existing functionality
7. Update any related documentation
