# Tasks: Production Readiness Remediation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-production-readiness/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per spec success criteria SC-020 through SC-022:
- SC-020: Achieve test pyramid targets (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e)
- SC-021: 100% functional requirement coverage (all 30 FR requirements)
- SC-022: Comprehensive security test suite

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single project structure - all paths relative to repository root:
- `src/` - Core implementation
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `server.py` - MCP server entry point

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - P1 stories (US3, US2, US1) should be completed first (critical security)
  - P2 stories (US5, US4) can proceed after P1 or in parallel if staffed
  - P3 stories (US6, US7) can proceed after P2 or in parallel if staffed
- **Bug Fixes (Phase 10)**: Can proceed in parallel with user stories
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories and bug fixes being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US3 (Credential Secrets)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (Command Injection)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US1 (File System Security)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US5 (Input Validation)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of other stories
- **US4 (MCP Compliance)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of other stories
- **US6 (Error Handling)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses file locking utility from Foundational
- **US7 (Resource Limits)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses limit utilities from Foundational

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) SHOULD be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Implementation tasks before integration tasks
- All tasks within story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T004-T008)
- Within US3: T011 can run in parallel with T010
- Within US1: T024-T025 can run in parallel, T028-T030 can run in parallel
- Within US5: T036-T040 can run in parallel
- Within US4: T049-T051 can run in parallel
- Within US6: T058-T064 can run in parallel (different files)
- Within US7: T073-T076 can run in parallel, T077-T080 can run in parallel
- Phase 10 bug fixes can all run in parallel (T089-T093)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch validation tasks together (different files, no dependencies):
Task T024: "Add project_path validator to src/models.py"
Task T025: "Add docs_path validator to src/models.py"

# Then launch symlink checks across multiple tools:
Task T028: "Add symlink checks to src/tools/memory.py"
Task T029: "Add symlink checks to src/tools/changes.py"
Task T030: "Add symlink checks to src/tools/dependencies.py"

# Launch all unit tests together:
Task T031: "Unit test for path traversal validator"
Task T032: "Unit test for path boundary utility"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 6

```bash
# Launch error handler replacements across all 8 tool files:
Task T057: "Replace silent handlers in src/tools/config.py"
Task T058: "Replace silent handlers in src/tools/memory.py"
Task T059: "Replace silent handlers in src/tools/platform.py"
Task T060: "Replace silent handlers in src/tools/validation.py"
Task T061: "Replace silent handlers in src/tools/quality.py"
Task T062: "Replace silent handlers in src/tools/changes.py"
Task T063: "Replace silent handlers in src/tools/dependencies.py"
Task T064: "Replace silent handlers in src/tools/workflows.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 User Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: US3 (Credential Secrets)
4. Complete Phase 4: US2 (Command Injection)
5. Complete Phase 5: US1 (File System Security)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 security fixes independently
7. Deploy/commit if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US3 (Credentials) → Test independently → Commit
3. Add US2 (Command Injection) → Test independently → Commit
4. Add US1 (Path Traversal) → Test independently → Commit (P1 complete!)
5. Add US5 (Input Validation) → Test independently → Commit
6. Add US4 (MCP Compliance) → Test independently → Commit (P2 complete!)
7. Add US6 (Error Handling) → Test independently → Commit
8. Add US7 (Resource Limits) → Test independently → Commit (P3 complete!)
9. Each story adds security/stability without breaking previous work

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: US3 + US2 (credentials and command injection)
   - Developer B: US1 (path traversal - most complex)
   - Developer C: US5 (input validation)
3. Then proceed to P2/P3 stories in parallel
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

- US2: Shell metacharacters in commit hash rejected
- US1: Path traversal attempts blocked
- US5: Edge case inputs handled gracefully
- US4: Tool hints accurate, responses within limits
- US6: Errors logged, no silent failures
- US7: Large projects respect limits

**MVP Scope**: US3 + US2 + US1 (all P1 security fixes) = Tasks T009-T035 (27 tasks)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent operations, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- TDD approach: Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement
- Commit after each user story completion
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All 125 existing tests must continue to pass
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
